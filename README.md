1. What is JSX, and why is it used?
   Ans: JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. It is used because JSX makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.

2. What is the difference between State and Props?
   Ans: States represent the internal data of a component, and Props are read-only attributes used to pass data from parent to child components.

3. What is the useState hook, and how does it work?
   Ans: The useState hook allows functional components to have state variables. It returns two values: the current state and a function to update it. When the update function is called, React re-renders the component with the new state value.

4. How can you share state between components in React?
   Ans: State can be shared by lifting the state up to the common parent component and passing it down as props.

5. How is event handling done in React?
   Ans: Event handling in React uses camelCase syntax and functions instead of strings.
